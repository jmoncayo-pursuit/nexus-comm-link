# Nexus Comm-Link: Development Roadmap 🚀

This document tracks the evolution of the Nexus Comm-Link from a "lab experiment" to a permanent fixture of our development process.

## 🎯 Immediate Intentions (Next Session)

### 🧩 Mobile UI Refinement
- [ ] **Reading Thoughts**: Implement a specialized, high-readability expansion mode for "Thought" blocks to make deep-thinking sessions easier to follow on mobile.
- [ ] **Accept Files Button**: Implement a remote click-relay for the "Accept" or "Apply" buttons in file blocks, allowing for one-tap deployment of AI-written code.

### 🧠 Model & Context Intelligence
- [ ] **Model Context Management**: UI indicators to show what files/blocks are currently active in the model's context.
- [ ] **Refresh Limit Awareness**: Visual tracking of model rate limits and token refresh cycles to avoid "Link Refused" scenarios.

### 🕹️ Advanced Remote Navigation
- [ ] **Scroll by Prompt**: Automatic navigation markers. Tap to snap the view to specific prompt headers or major system events.

### ⚙️ Nexus Core Configuration
- [ ] **Global Settings Page**: A dedicated interface to manage server ports, auth tokens, refresh intervals, and UI themes without restarting the server.
