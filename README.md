## 🚀 Quick Start

> 💡 **Tip:** While we recommend starting Nexus first, the server is now smart enough to wait and automatically connect whenever Nexus becomes available!

### Step 1: Launch Nexus in Debug Mode

Start Nexus with the remote debugging port enabled:

**Option A: Using Right-Click Context Menu (Recommended)**
- Run `install_context_menu.bat` (Windows) or `./install_context_menu.sh` (Linux) and select **[1] Install**
- Then right-click any project folder → **"Open with Nexus (Debug)"** (now with visual icons!)

**Option B: Manual Command**
```bash
nexus . --remote-debugging-port=9000
```

### Step 2: Open or Start a Chat

- In Nexus, open an **existing chat** from the bottom-right panel, **OR**
- Start a **new chat** by typing a message

> 💡 The server needs an active chat session to capture snapshots. Without this, you'll see "chat container not found" errors.

### Step 3: Run the Server

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x start_nexus_connect.sh   # First time only
./start_nexus_connect.sh
```

The script will:
- Verify Node.js and Python dependencies
- Auto-kill any existing server on port 3000
- **Wait for Nexus** if it's not started yet
- Display a **QR Code** and your **Link** (e.g., `https://192.168.1.5:3000`)
- Provide numbered steps for easy connection

### Step 4: Connect Your Phone (Local Wi-Fi)

1. Ensure your phone is on the **same Wi-Fi network** as your PC
2. Open your mobile browser and enter the **URL shown in the terminal**
3. If using HTTPS: Accept the self-signed certificate warning on first visit

## 🌍 NEW: Global Remote Access (Web Mode)

Access your Nexus session from **anywhere in the world** (Mobile Data, outside Wi-Fi) with secure passcode protection.

### Setup (First Time)
1. **Get an ngrok Token**: Sign up for free at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) and get your "Authtoken".
2. **Automatic Configuration (Recommended)**: Simply run any launcher script. They will detect if `.env` is missing and automatically create it using `.env.example` as a template.
3. **Manual Setup**: Alternatively, copy `.env.example` to `.env` manually and update the values:
   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env   # Windows
   cp .env.example .env     # Mac/Linux
   ```
   Update the `.env` file with your details:
   ```env
   NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your_token_here
   APP_PASSWORD=your_secure_passcode
   XXX_API_KEY=your-ai-provider-key
   PORT=3000
   ```

### Usage
- **Mac/Linux**: Run `./start_nexus_connect_web.sh`

The script will launch the server and provide a **Public URL** (e.g., `https://abcd-123.ngrok-free.app`). 

**Two Ways to Connect:**
1. **Magic Link (Easiest)**: Scan the **Magic QR Code** displayed in the terminal. It logs you in automatically!
2. **Manual**: 
   - Open the URL on your phone.
   - Enter your `APP_PASSWORD` to log in.

> 💡 **Tip:** Devices on the same local Wi-Fi still enjoy direct access without needing a password.

## 🔒 Enabling HTTPS (Recommended)

For a secure connection without the browser warning icon:

### Option 1: Command Line
```bash
node generate_ssl.js
```
- Uses **OpenSSL** if available (includes your IP in certificate)
- Falls back to **Node.js crypto** if OpenSSL not found
- Creates certificates in `./certs/` directory

### Option 2: Web UI
1. Start the server on HTTP
2. Look for the yellow **"⚠️ Not Secure"** banner
3. Click **"Enable HTTPS"** button
4. Restart the server when prompted

### After Generating:
1. **Restart the server** - it will automatically detect and use HTTPS.
2. **On your phone's first visit**:
   - You'll see a security warning (normal for self-signed certs).
   - Tap **"Advanced"** → **"Proceed to site"**.
   - The warning won't appear again!

### macOS: Adding Right-Click "Quick Action" (Optional)

Since macOS requires Automator for context menu entries, follow these steps manually:

1.  Open **Automator** (Spotlight → type "Automator").
2.  Click **File → New** and select **Quick Action**.
3.  At the top, set:
    - "Workflow receives current" → **folders**
    - "in" → **Finder**
4.  In the left sidebar, search for **"Run Shell Script"** and drag it to the right pane.
5.  Set "Shell" to `/bin/zsh` and "Pass input" to **as arguments**.
6.  Paste this script:
    ```bash
    cd "$1"
    nexus . --remote-debugging-port=9000
    ```
7.  **Save** the Quick Action with a name like `Open with Nexus (Debug)`.
8.  Now you can right-click any folder in Finder → **Quick Actions → Open with Nexus (Debug)**.
